Hello, Good morning, Sir.

I answer this for my insufficient documents for my visa.

1.  Why i wish to study in New Zealand..
I have several reasons that i want to study in New Zealand. I would like to study abroad to enlarge my sight. Since I've started this job, I would have impoved my skills. As foreigner, I would like to study somewhere safe. I've been in a few countries short and long. And I felt people are kind in New Zealand. I think a student is not a superior position in society and i don't want to be in danger with my wife when i am a student.  

Second reason is that my wife like New Zealand personally. I am going to pass through 
hardship of living abroad without family and friend but wife. And it is sufficient reason to choose country to study. 

2. How and why i chose your course and education provider, the advantages obtaining this qualification will provide me, or my intentions after completing this course

To be honest, I chose reasonable school for my situation at this moment.  As i spent half of my saving for studying abroad, I must make a result. I thought the majority of programming job is in Auckland. And I can make network in Auckland while I am studying. And as a married man, I need to have saving to protect and provide my family, my wife. So i rather chose reasonble tuition fee than just high quality education. 

After i graduate this course, i can get job searching visa for 2 year. During the period, I will get a job. I have almost three years experience now. I will afford more time to improve my skill so I believe I cound acheive what i plan now. And my experience in New Zealand will be a step for my future.
