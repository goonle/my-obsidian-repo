#### Study Looks at parents' Influence on College Choices

When you're in high school, deciding what you'd like to study at college is not always easy - if you want to go to college at all.

We may choose to balance our own hopes and dreams with those of our parents, as well as thinking about  the cources that may help us ti find work in the future.

But what factors help us to make our final decision?

Researchers from South Korea have been trying to find out about the effect that conversations with parents have on high school students' cource choices.

And they think they might have found a pattern.

The study showed that the more time children spend talking with their parents about their choices, the more likely they are to study medicine, education, physical education, art or music after finising high school.

The researchers looked at data that tracked almost 1,300 pupils who were in the second year of high school in 2016, and followed them as they moved on to college.

They found that pupils who talked regularly with their parents about their interests and their future studies were more likely to choose courses that need quite "specialized capabilities," said The Korean Herald.

That's instead of courses like humanities and social sciences.

The research team said that Korean parents were now having more  of an influence on their children's choices about college.

"Talking with parents greatly affected students' decisions on whether to go to college," they said.

But there were other important factors, too. Children with richer parents were more likely to go to college.

And pupils with higher grades in math were more likely to go to college, but grades in Korean English were not as important in determining whether or not a pupil went on to study at college.
