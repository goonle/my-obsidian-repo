#### Japan Discusses Increasing definition of old to 70
At what age do we become elderly? It's a question we mak ask ourselves at diffrenet times in our lives, and it;s not an easy question to answer.

Most researchers, as well as some governments, define old age as beginning at 65. But as life expectancy around the world increases and people live healthily for longer, do our definitions of old age need to chnage?

The Japanese government has been thinking about this question.  It has been discussing the idea of changing the point when old begins in the country from 65 to 70.

But is this really important?

On its own, the definition of old age doesn't change the way a person feels. In Japan, where about one in 10 people are 80 or older, many people stay healty and active long past 65.

However, some think the possibvble chnage may be a way of gettting people to work for longer.

Fuji News Network spoke to people about the possible change. One man in his 40s said: "I think it's outrageous. How long do we have to work?"

He said he was worried that pensions might not be paid until later in life.

A man in his 70s said he also thought this was being discussed so the government could delay the paaying of pensions.

Japan's national pension usually starts being paid at 65, although people can choose to start receiving it as early as 60.

Manay companies in Japan also have a mandatory retirement age, which is often 60. If people would like to continue working, companies must employ them until 65.

However, there are poeple who work long past the mandatory retirement age.

The government has been discussing ways to combat Japan's labor shortage, which has been made worse by the country's low birthrate.
