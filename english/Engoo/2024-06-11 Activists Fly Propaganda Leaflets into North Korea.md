##### Activists Fly Propaganda Leaflets into North Korea
A South Korean activists' group said on June 6 that it flew large balloons carrying propaganda leaftlets toward Noth Korea. The North has threatened to send more balloons witth manure and trash across the border in response to such campaigns.

North Korea had stopped its flights of rubbish-carrying balloons but threatened to restart them if South Korean activists sent leaflets again.

The South Korean civilian group, led by North Korean defector Park Sang-hak, said it floated 10 balloons tied to 200,000 anti-Pyongyang leaflets, USB sticks with K-pop songs and South Korean dramas and one-dollar US bills from a border town on June 6.

Park's long-running balloon activities have caused furious protests from North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any attempt to undermine Kim Jong Un's rule.

After North Korea started launching hundreds of trash-carrying balloons on South Korea the week prior, Kim's powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong, said the campaign was in response to South Korean leafleting. Observers say North Korea was referring to Park's previous balloon activities in May.

"We sent the truth and love, medicines, on-dollar bills and songs. But a barbaric Kim Jong Un sent us filth and garbage and he hasn't made a wod of apology over that," Park said in a statement. "Our group, the Fighters for Free North Korea, will keep sending our leaflets, which are the letters of truth and freedom ..."

North Korea's balloon campaign was seen as an attempt to cause a divide in South Korea over its government's tought policy on the North. South Korean officials say they cannot ban private citizens from flying balloons to North Korea, After a court last year *struck down* a law banning such leafelting as a violation of free speech.

In reaction to the North's balloon campaign, South Korea has suspended a 2018 tension-easing agreement with North Korea. This allows South Korea to restart live-firing exercises and anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts at border areas - which North Korea is likely to respond to with its own military steps.
