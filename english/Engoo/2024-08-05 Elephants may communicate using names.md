```myAnswer
I knew the elephants are so clever and also heard that elephants interact with zoo-keeper and mimic their words. What i surprised was not the study's finding but the fact scientist hadn't found the evidences of animals using names. I though all of animals calling each other with name because All of cartoons does.

I’ve always known that elephants are incredibly clever and have even heard of them interacting with their keepers and mimicking words. What surprised me, however, wasn’t the study’s finding but the fact that scientists hadn’t previously found evidence of animals using names. I assumed all animals used names for each other because that’s what cartoons often depict.
